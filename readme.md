# LSTM-CNN-Music-Genre-Classification
> RNN-LSTM, CNN, Simple NeuralNetworks

This repo is meant to provide simple and straightforward started codes to those starting a project in music Genre Classification using Deep Learning Techniques.

I hope that this work can help in several Deep Learning, Machine Learning projects in *Music Genre Classification*. 

The Dataset used in this research is from [LAMA : A World Music Dataset](https://github.com/brucewlee/LAMA-Music-Genre-Dataset)

## Getting Started
> Some data couldn't be uploaded to GitHub because the file size was too large. Instead, I attached a Harvard Dataverse link below to retrieve the data.

The data contained in **LAMA** can be classified into three categories: 
1. **NN_Music_Classification.py** -> Simple Neural Network Made with TensorFlow
2. **CNN_Music_Classification.py** -> Convolutional Neural Network Made with TensorFlow
3. **LSTM_Music_Classification.py** -> RNN-LSTM Made with TensorFlow

## Other Files
1. **main.py** -> Make predictions using saved models from running the above codes
2. **test_data** -> Provided for use in **main.py** 
3. **LAMA_DataSet.json** -> MFCC training Data from [LAMA : A World Music Dataset](https://github.com/brucewlee/LAMA-Music-Genre-Dataset)
