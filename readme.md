This repo is meant to provide simple and straightforward starter codes to those beginning a project in music Genre Classification using Deep Learning Techniques like LSTM, CNN, and just plain old-school Neural Networks. This model can classify new audio files into four categories: Latin American, Asian, Middle Eastern, and African Music.

I hope that this work can help in several Deep Learning, Machine Learning projects in *Music Genre Classification*. The training data isn't provided here.

## Getting Started

The three main model construction/training/evaluation algorithms as below: NN, CNN, LSTM.
1. **NN_Music_Classification.py** -> Simple Neural Network Made with TensorFlow
2. **CNN_Music_Classification.py** -> Convolutional Neural Network Made with TensorFlow
3. **LSTM_Music_Classification.py** -> RNN-LSTM Made with TensorFlow
